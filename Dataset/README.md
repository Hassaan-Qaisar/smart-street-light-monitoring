## DPU-ALDOSKI dataset of Monitoring and Controlling distributed far distances energy consumed system based on Internet of Things
### Abstract
This article presents the created dataset obtained from implementation of a proposed distributed energy management system based on the Internet of Things (IoT). The proposed approach was implemented and evaluated at two distinct institutions, namely Duhok and Shekhan, which are geographically distant from each other. The proposed system comprises two primary phases, namely Monitoring and Controlling, which are implemented using ESP32 microcontrollers. The power usage indicators, namely Voltage, current, and Frequency, have been subjected to meticulous monitoring and regulation. Three principal methodologies are employed for each institution, namely: comprehensive monitoring of all metrics for the entire institution, comprehensive monitoring of all metrics for the uncontrolled laboratory, and monitoring and regulation of all metrics for the controlled laboratory. The technology in question continuously collects data, leading to the creation of a substantial energy management database. The data collection process involved the utilization of server-side protocols, namely Message Query Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
